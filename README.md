Lanchon -- Minimalist extensible launcher
===
Lanchon is a minimalist and desktop agnostic extensible launcher inspired by [Lancelot](http://kde-apps.org/content/show.php/Lancelot?content=87914). Plugins can be written for Lanchon to perform whatever type of query the user likes. Currently the project is in a development stage so no useful plugins exist yet. The following features are expected from the first stable release of Lanchon:

 * Plugin to match executable programs in the computer.
 * Plugin to search with recoll.
 * Arithmetic plugin
 * Minimalist GUI which provides a search bar and a list of results
